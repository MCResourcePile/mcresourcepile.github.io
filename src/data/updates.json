With over 40% of views going to our Overcast Network map collection, we would just like to thank all the map authors which have provided their maps to ResourcePile and making them accessable to the community which grew to enjoy them greatly. We're always looking to expand our map collection, so if you would like to add your maps to our collection please consider filling out <a href=\"https://mcresourcepile.github.io/admin/forms/maps\" target=\"_blank\">this submission form</a> regarding your creations."
