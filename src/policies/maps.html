  ### 1. Rights and Ownership
  Authors credited in the `map.xml` file retain full rights to any maps submitted and stored in GitHub repositories maintained by MCResourcePile.

  ### 2. Map Acquisition and Distribution
  MCResourcePile map collections include a mix of self-maintained GitHub map repositories and repositories maintained by third-parties not affiliated with MCResourcePile. Depending on the source there may be different permissions associated with the map files. MCResourcePile only has control over the licensing and maintenance of maps uploaded to repositories maintained by MCResourcePile.

  #### 2.1. Repositories Maintained by MCResourcePile
  MCResourcePile has obtained an explicit approval from at least **one** of the documented authors of any single map before uploading the map to one of the GitHub repositories maintained by MCResourcePile. This approval permits MCResourcePile to:
  - Upload the Minecraft map level files and `map.xml` file to one of MCResourcePile's GitHub repositories
  - List the map on our webpage and map collections for download
  - License the map materials under a license agreed upon by the contacted author and MCResourcePile

  Where a download to a map has been publicly posted by any one of the documented authors, MCResourcePile may upload the version of the map as-is from the public download or obtain an updated version of the map to host and distribute under no license, unless explicitly licensed in the original public download.

  Repositories maintained by MCResourcePile can be found on [GitHub here](https://github.com/orgs/MCResourcePile/repositories).

  #### 2.2. Repositories Maintained by Third-Parties
  MCResourcePile includes maps from GitHub repositories not maintained by MCResourcePile in map collections.

  Licensing is determined by either:
  - A global license applied to the entire repository as set by the third-party maintainer, or
  - The inclusion of a `LICENSE.txt` document in the map folder which defines the license and terms for an individual map.

  If no license could be found a message encouraging the user to contact the map authors will be presented.

  If a license is found but it could not be identified as [one of the supported licenses](https://github.com/MCResourcePile/map-fetcher/blob/main/src/index.js#L178) a message informing the user to refer to the included `LICENSE.txt` file in the download will be presented.

  Updates, attribution, licensing, and content removal must be referred to the repository maintainer. MCResourcePile cannot make updates or changes to the Minecraft map level or site data for maps maintained by third-parties.

  ### 3. Attribution
  Authors will be attributed for their work as long as they are included as an [author in the map's XML](https://pgm.dev/docs/modules/general/main#authors--contributors). If an author is not included in the XML they are unable to be attributed in the map collections.

  Personalised Minecraft avatars will not be present where no UUID is included in the XML. Usernames may be missing if the UUID has not been resolved to the current Minecraft username. This generally updates after each site update and on the first day of every month.

  ### 4. Content Removal
  Map authors are free to have their maps removed from MCResourcePile if they no longer wish to have their map published. Please reach out to our Managers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ygNgxKj) citing which maps you want removed. Removal of maps sourced from GitHub repositories that are not maintained by MCResourcePile will require you to contact the maintainer of that specific repository.

  We are unable to prevent anyone from using the content where an individual or party has obtained a licensed copy of your map prior to the content being removed from MCResourcePile.
